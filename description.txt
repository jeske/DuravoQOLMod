Duravo QOL is a set of refinements to make Terraria feel more engaging
and rewarding, from the first moment of gameplay to the last.

Our Quality Of Life Goals:
- Deepen engagement with Terraria's rich world
- Increase engagement with the crafted armor progression
- Give purpose to biome-specific base crafting items

Current Features:

- *Persistent Player Position* Your character stays where you left them. The only fast travel is pylons.
- *Crafted Armor rebalance* Shifted set defense bonuses into armor pieces and added new mix-and-match set bonuses.
- *Reactive Shield Effect* Low-tier chestpieces get a reactive shield effect, making crafting armor feel more exciting, and giving the new player visual feedback to help understand combat.
- *Mini-Spelunker Shiny-Buff* Makes crafting more fun

Coming Soon:
- Digging-based spawn scaling
- Enhanced enemy behaviors (variable jump size, digging)
- Strategic travel systems

For players who want their victories to feel truly earned.
