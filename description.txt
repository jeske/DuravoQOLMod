Duravo Mod enhances the survival RPG experience by increasing the need
for bases, making biome-specific bases serve a functional purpose,
encouraging combat, enhancing gear progression, and making combat less
avoidable - by removing some NPC tricking exploits.

Our Conceptual Goals:
- Deepen engagement with Terraria's rich world
- Make more biomes "start viable"
- Create satisfying tension between risk and reward
- Increase engagement with the armor progression
- Increase the investment to reach zoom-zoom level gameplay
- Give purpose to biome-specific base crafting items

Current Features:

- *Persistent Player Position* Your character stays where you left them. The only fast travel is pylons.
- Armor rebalance: New non-combat set-bonus to make breaking sets viable. New chestpiece bonuses, including a visual shield, to make armor more fun and help new players learn combat.

Coming Soon:
- Digging-based spawn scaling
- Enhanced enemy behaviors (variable jump size, digging)
- Strategic travel systems

Stretch Goal:
- Best speedrun times should increase from 50 minutes to 5+ hours, because one can't blast away and skip/ignore enemies, progression, etc.

For players who want their victories to feel truly earned.
