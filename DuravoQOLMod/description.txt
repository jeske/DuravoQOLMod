Duravo QOL is a collection of quality-of-life improvements that make Terraria 
more intuitive and enjoyable without changing core gameplay.

Website: http://duravomod.org

Core Philosophy:
- Tweaks to make Terraria a little more like we wish it was
- Mechanics that add visual clarity and fun
- All features individually toggleable

Current Features:

Persistent Player Position: Log back in exactly where you left off. No more losing where you are because you need a break.
Crafted Armor Rework: Defense baked into pieces (no penalty for breaking sets), plus new 2-piece mix-and-match bonuses.
Emergency Shield: Chestpieces grant reactive shields with visual feedback showing damage blocked.
Shiny Buff: 2pc bonus making nearby ores sparkle (only slightly beyond torch range), making early mining a little more fun.
Smart Minion Pathfinding: Minions navigate around obstacles using A* pathfinding instead of getting stuck.
Crafting Info Panel: Organized visual reference showing all craftable items by category. Hover for recipes, click to focus in crafting menu.
Mini Player Healthbar: Configurable mini-healthbar under your player, responds to environment lighting (if desired).

Coming Soon:
- Splitting out Server-Side stuff into another mod
- Native Biome Bootstrap (craft basic stations from [i]any[/i] local materials)
