## Travel Rework

### Problem

Mirror and Recall Potions provide instant escape from anywhere. Combined with spawn-on-logout, there's zero commitment to exploration. Every expedition is risk-free.

### Solution

Delete recall items. Replace with earned portal infrastructure.

### Changes

**Removed from game:**

* Magic Mirror
* Ice Mirror
* Cell Phone (recall function)
* Recall Potions
* Remove from loot tables, crafting, NPC shops

**Softcore exception:**
Softcore players get a UI "Return Home" button. They can suicide for free anyway, so recall is just convenience. Let them have it - they chose easy mode.
