## Crafting

* [X] strange gap present between window and tab, despite tab asset indicating it should be flush based on partial outline
* [X] no indication of craftability for top row
* [X] Highlight when hovering does not match the shape of the rounded square item icon
* [ ] Recipes in the crafting window remain "unknown" despite having all requires materials and stations, and the item itself

## Minions

* [ ] Pathfound minion routes seem to have no or a very high upwards cap on speed?
* [ ] Didnt notice anything notibly wrong with any of the pathfinding despite the odd speed at times

## Armor

* [ ] 'Fragile' is a debuff yet uses the blue buff background
* [ ] 'super shiny' set pieces appear to unintuitively also contribute to the 'shiny' set bonus
* [ ] "shielding" effects would benefit greatly from custom sprites or more clear visual effects. Changing the visual effect based on the equipped set is a nice touch
* [ ] Iron/lead armor appears to strangely have been left out of the changes to ore armors?

## Meta

Feedback:

* World position persistance is a bit of a strange feature for a QoL mod, especially given it already exists as a standalone mod.
* Feel like your mod has a small identity crisis, its billed as a QoL mod while also containing large but very contained content reworks and behavioral changes to things like enemies and minions, while also having gimmick features like world position persistance.
* Having configuration for all the features is nice, but it has an issue where if im looking to include something into a playthrough or modpack its hard to reach for such a strange set of features together (note modpacks dont come with configs!)

Actions:

* [ ] split into separate mods (shield, minion changes, crafting, world persistence)
* [X] You should really add some images to your workshop page. Having a seperate site is nice but the clickthrough rate from your workshop page to the site will very likely be low, and only improved if anything by having a good showcase on steam itself
