[h1]Duravo Mod[/h1]

Enhances the survival RPG experience by increasing the need for bases, making biome-specific bases serve a functional purpose, encouraging combat, enhancing gear progression, and making combat less avoidable.

[h2]🎯 Our Goals[/h2]
[list]
[*] Deepen engagement with Terraria's rich world
[*] Make more biomes "start viable"
[*] Create satisfying tension between risk and reward
[*] Increase engagement with armor progression
[*] Increase investment needed to reach zoom-zoom gameplay
[*] Give purpose to biome-specific base crafting items
[/list]

[h2]✅ Current Features[/h2]

[b]Persistent Player Position[/b]
Your character stays where you left them. Log out in a cave? Wake up in that cave. The only fast travel is pylons.

[b]Armor Rebalance[/b]
[list]
[*] New non-combat set bonuses make breaking sets viable
[*] [b]Emergency Shield[/b] - Chestpieces grant damage-absorbing shields to help new players learn combat
[*] [b]Shiny[/b] - Set bonus that makes nearby ores and gems sparkle
[*] Defense redistributed into individual pieces (no more losing set bonus defense when upgrading one piece)
[/list]

[b]Minion Tethering[/b]
[list]
[*] Minions stay near you - no more AFK murder rooms
[*] Smart pathfinding follows you through terrain
[/list]

[h2]🔜 Coming Soon[/h2]
[list]
[*] Digging-based spawn scaling
[*] Enhanced enemy behaviors (smart jumping, burrowing)
[*] Strategic travel systems (removing recall, adding portal networks)
[*] Depth-scaled difficulty
[/list]

[h2]🎮 Stretch Goal[/h2]
Best speedrun times should increase from 50 minutes to 5+ hours, because you can no longer blast past and skip/ignore enemies, progression, and exploration.
